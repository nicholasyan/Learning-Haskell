# Learning Haskell

This winter break (2015), I have decided to dive into functional programming:
* to satisfy my intellectual curiousity about the subject
* to better prepare myself for the [future] (https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9#.bxkl3prpe)
* to improve my imperative programming skills by viewing programming in [another light] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY)

After some research, I have chosen Haskell as my jumping off point. 

Based on Christopher Allen's article [Functional Education] (http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html), I have chosen to begin by completing UPenn's [CIS 194 (Introduction to Haskell) class] (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) followed by National ICT Australia's (NICTA) [Functional Programming Course] (https://github.com/NICTA/course/).
